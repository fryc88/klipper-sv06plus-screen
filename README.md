# Sovol SV06 Plus stock screen with Klipper

[![Based on Desuuuu / DGUS-reloaded-Klipper screen firmware, originally for Creality printers.  ](https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper)](https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper) and  [![Desuuuu/klipper branch  ](https://github.com/Desuuuu/klipper)](https://github.com/Desuuuu/klipper)



This is manual specifically for Sovol SV06 plus printer, however i successfully used screen firmware and most of config with SV01 Pro, and it can be used with SV04 as well, so if you want to try on other T5L1 chip based screens - feel free, it might work as well.

## Features

Basic functions are working fine, like:
- Preheating, changing temperature during the print, changing fan speed, etc.
- Auto home
